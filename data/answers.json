		"question":"What is the origin of COVID-19?",
		"answer":"It was quickly determined that the virus was first identified in Wuhan, China, but its exact origin remains a mystery. The most popular theory up to date is the possibility of the virus being transmitted from one wild animal to another in the Huanan Wet Market in Wuhan, before infecting humans who would have purchased the affected meats to consume. However, only 27 out of the first 41 patients had been in the market, which raises many eyebrows (Ellis, 2020). While everyone has agreed upon the fact that the virus most likely originated in bats, scientists and researchers have yet to determine whether an intermediate host (another animal) contracted the virus to then pass it onto humans.",

		"question":"Are viruses alive?",
		"answer":"Viruses are submicroscopic particles that technically are not living organisms, normally seen as \"organisms at the edge of life\", since viruses can only partially meet the criteria for living. For example, living organisms often require their own metabolism or must be able to reproduce naturally without any external aid, two tasks that viruses are not able to perform. However, these infectious particles still possess genes in the form of nucleic acid and evolve by natural selection. It is due to this ambiguous standing that opinions on whether viruses should or should not be considered living vary greatly.",

		"question":"How does COVID-19 infect human cells?",
		"answer":"When a person gets infected, they inhale droplets containing the virus. Consequently, this comes in contact with various parts of our body. Specifically, when the virus lines the inner walls of our nose, that’s when things can get tricky (Wadman et al., 2020). This region in our body is rich in cell surface receptors, called, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Generally, viruses correspond to intracellular parasites; they try to replicate themselves in order to prosper. Current research showcases how the SARS- CoV-2 is able to do so via ACE2. These membrane proteins are joined to the sympathetic nervous system (Foley 2020). Their role consists of binding to the ACE2 hormone. Therefore, acting through AT1 receptors, which stimulate cardiac growth (Zisman 2005). Scientists believe that the nature of covid-19 can initially evade our immune system by latching on this receptor and gaining access into to the human body (Cristiani et al.,).",

		"question": "What organs are affected by COVID-19?",
		"answer": "Since the ACE 2 is found to be the human receptor of SARS-Cov-2, organs that express this enzyme are the ones mainly affected; namely, the lungs, the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys. The alveolar cells in the lungs are the major targets since they play a very important role in gas exchange during cellular respiration and provide a direct entry for respiratory droplets into the lungs (Sheshe et al.,2020). Furthermore, other research has confirmed that this new virus can cause nerve damage between the blood-brain barrier and enter the central nervous system (CNS) by penetrating the vascular system. When this new pneumonia virus’s particles bind to the ACE 2 receptors, it also causes very elevated blood pressure that increases the risk of a cerebral hemorrhage in patients (Wu et al., 2020 as cited by Baig et al., 2020).",

		"question": "What are coronaviruses?",
		"answer": "\"Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses that are distributed broadly among humans, other mammals, and birds and that cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurologic diseases. Six coronavirus species are known to cause human disease. Four viruses - 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1 - are prevalent and typically cause common cold symptoms in immunocompetent individuals. [T]wo other strains - severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - are zoonotic in origin and have been linked to sometimes fatal illness.

		"question": "What genes are essential to SARS-nCov-2 replication?",
		"answer": "Casually said, viruses are lazy. Coronaviruses are no exception. They use most of the host cell's machinery to make what they need to replicate (5). Viruses have genes that encode for at least two crucial proteins; replicase, and a capsid. The replicase gene of coronaviruses occupy two-thirds of the genome (about 20 kb). It utilizes a 5′ cap structure along witha 3′ poly (A) tail, that allows the coronavirus to mimic a mRNA that will induce the translation of replicase polyproteins. As for the capsid, generally referred to by the broader term nucleocapsid, is helically symmetrical. Nucleocapsids are not simple barriers,they are complex and must be sufficiently stable in the environment to protect the contained nucleic acid genome of the coronavirus, and at the same time play multiple roles in the interaction between the virion and host cell (J. H., Strauss, E. G. Strauss, 2008).",

		"question": "How does COVID-19 testing work?",
		"answer": "Testing of SARS-CoV-2 is mainly done using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR) method (Tiner, 2020), which has the advantage of directly determining the presence of viral RNA (Kent, 2020). This allows for diagnosis of infected individuals before the apparition of symptoms, which is very helpful for early quarantining intervention in order to \"break [the] transmission chain\" (Kent, 2020, paras.6). A swab is taken from the patient’s upper respiratory tract (Tiner, 2020), and the virus RNA is isolated in a laboratory setting.",

Counter-intuitive as it may seem, however, down-regulation of ACE2 receptors is actually associated with higher risks of severe infection symptoms due to ACE2’s regulatory role on the angiotensin-renin system, on blood-clotting factors, and on the innate immune response.",

		"answer": "There are currently no sure-fire solutions against SARS-CoV-2 pathogens and, therefore, the identification of antiviral agents and pharmacological treatments to combat this pathogenic disease is urgently needed.  Since the beginning of the identification of this virus, there have been multiple probable pharmacological treatments and amongst all of them, Remdesivir has been recognized as the most promising therapy.      <br><br>There are several drugs such as Lopinavir, Ritonavir, corticosteroids, remedisvir and ribavirin, which have been used to combat the previous infections, yet their rate of effectiveness has remained controversial. There are currently multiple FDA-approved drugs against SARS-CoV-19 such as Ribavirin, Chloroquine, Remdesivir and Favipiravir. Remdesivir is an antiviral drug that was first developed by Gilead Sciences to combat the Ebola Hemorrhagic Virus (EBV) in Africa. (Sanders.J, Monogue M et all, 2020). In 2015, the effectiveness of this treatment against the Ebola virus was considered to be insignificant. Remedisvir’s importance became apparent when it showed its potential to inhibit coronavirus polymerase.

For example, homeless people, because they may be unable to safely shelter in place, are highly exposed to the danger of the virus. People without access to running water, refugees, migrants, or displaced persons also stand to suffer disproportionately both from the pandemic and its aftermath – whether due to limited movement, fewer employment opportunities, increased xenophobia etc",
